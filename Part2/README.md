# HRSChallenge Part 2


Your task for Part 2 is to review a piece of existing code and demonstrate how you would improve it. The code is in the included file named PatientModel.ts.

1. Explain the purpose of the filterLatestReadings function as best as you can.
2. How would you improve the code for readability, maintainability, etc? This can include anything from small changes to rewriting it entirely. Explanations of your reasoning behind your changes is recommended. You can choose to make the changes to the function directly, or to write pseudocode to demonstrate your thinking, or to explain your thoughts in any other way that would effectively convey them to us.
